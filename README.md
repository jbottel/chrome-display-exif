chrome-display-exif
======================

chrome-display-exif is a Google Chrome/Chromium extension which allows Chrome users to send any file on the web 
to be analyzed by [Jeffrey Friedl's Image Metadata Viewer](http://regex.info/exif.cgi), which is a fantastic web-based
tool which provides a quick summary of both EXIF and other image metadata.

In order to use chrome-display-exif, find any image in your browser (JPEG is the best option, since 
most JPEGs have at least some EXIF data) and right-click to bring up the context menu. 
The default option is called "Get EXIF Data". 


How to Install
---
Until this extension is added to the Chrome marketplace, the best way to install this extension is 
to download the zip file and add it to Chrome. 
In recent versions of Chrome, you may have to enable 'Developer Mode' in order to use the extension.
